01-hello demo (hello world)
================================================================================

About the Sample App
- the simplest program to get running with Bluccino
- uses the Bluccino bl_prt() function
- bl_prt() is an exact equivalent for the Zephyr printk() function, supporting
  variable argument lists
- note that bl_prt() requires a newline character (\n) at the end of the line

Lessons to Learn
- how to write a 'hello world' program within Bluccino framework
- how to print a message to console with Bluccino primitives (bl_prt)
- get familar with Zephyr project structure (src folder for the source code,
  CMakeLists.txt, project config file prj.conf, README.rst file)
- get familar with the two step Zephyr build process (CMake process, after that
  compilation and linking)
- how to run an application

Bluccino Primitives Used
- bl_prt(): generic (formatted) print function (like printf() or printk())

Zephyr Project structure
================================================================================

- 01-hello shows alread the common Zephyr project structure, which should be
  understood (at least coarsly) from the beginning

  01-hello
     +- src                  source file folder (containing all sources)
     |  +- main.c            C-source file containing main() function
     +- CMakeLists.txt       CMake file (being executed if prj.conf changes)
     +- prj.conf             project config (which Zephyr modules to include?)
     +- README.rst           readme file (giving some overview information)
     +- sample.yaml          device tree binding info and test case definitions

================================================================================
CMakeLists.txt
================================================================================

- important to understand is CMakeLists.txt file with the following details
- 1) setting up the project name
- 2) defining symbol LIB for the library path
- 3) defining symbol BLU for the Bluccino library path
- 4) defining symbol SRC for the folder containing the sources
- 5) defining include folders ${SRC} and ${BLU}
- 6) linking both ${SRC}/main.c file and ${BLU}/bluccino.c library source

Exercices
================================================================================

Exercise 1
- logging is essential during the debugging of event driven applications and
  using different colors for logging can be very helpful during debugging, thus
  get experienced with using colors
- replace line
     bl_prt("hello, world!\n");
  by
     bl_prt(BL_R "hello, world!\n");
- what will change?

Exercise 2
- find the header file where symbol BL_R is defined
- what is the meaning behind BL_R?
- why is there not a comma between BL_R and "hello, world!\n" ?

Exercise 3
- rewrite 01-hello to print "hello" in green, "world" in magenta, and any other
  characters in black!

Exercise 4
- why might it be preferable to use bl_prt() instead of printk() in Bluccino
  applications, even it seems that bl_prt is just an alias for printk?
